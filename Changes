Revision history for Perl extension Config::MethodProxy.

{{$NEXT}}

 - Support $proxy as an alternative to &proxy so that it isn't parsed
   as a YAML anchor.
 - Add extra validation for things like method proxies with undefined
   package and method names, which means better error messages closer
   to the caller.
