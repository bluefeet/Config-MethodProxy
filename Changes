Revision history for Perl extension Data::MethodProxy.

0.02 2016-11-09

 - Switch from Test::Stream to Test2::Bundle::Extended.
 - Support $proxy as an alternative to &proxy so that it isn't parsed
   as a YAML anchor.
 - Add extra validation for things like method proxies with undefined
   package and method names, which means better error messages closer
   to the caller.

0.01 2015-12-29

 - First release.
